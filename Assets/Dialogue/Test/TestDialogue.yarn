Hikari: This is a test dialogue for the game.

Hikari: What happens when you have a whole block of text that goes on and on and on...does the background text box object expand with this text or does the text overflow to the bottom or does it mess with the vertical grouping in the canvas layout i need my questions answered please ok i tested it out it works great and fits in the background textbox that i made instead of overspilling onto the character name box or to the bottom of the page out of the box
